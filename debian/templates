Template: freenx/key_type
Type: select
Choices: NoMachine Keys, Custom keys, Remove freenx keys, Manual setup
_Description: Which key type should freenx use?
 NoMachine Keys: Allow login with the key shipped with the NoMachine client.
 This is not as secure, but it simplifies the configuration of clients.
 .
 Custom keys: Create custom keys for freenx, while this is the most secure
 option you will have to distribute the server key to all involved clients,
 import your server's /var/lib/nxserver/home/.ssh/client.id_dsa.key to your
 nx client (custom keys are not supported upstream).
 .
 Manual setup: setup freenx manually using /usr/sbin/nxsetup, leave existing 
 configurations alone.
 .
 Remove freenx keys: Remove or don't create keys and leave freenx
 unconfigured.
